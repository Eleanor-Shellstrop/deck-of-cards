## Deck of Cards

This project is to demonstrate and practice JS, CSS and HTML using OOP.

Press the "SHUFFLE" button to shuffle the deck of cards! 

Using object-oriented JavaScript, I made a Card object and a Deck object to manipulate the cards more easily for future projects. 
Can be used as a base for several card games. 

No special programs required, download and run from your text editor.
